
TEE is a Unix-like T pipe connection for DOS and works like all other
text filters.

A pipe is a series of command or device redirections, by means of |,
>, >> or <. For instance:

type file.txt | sort /r > prn
sort < file.txt | find /i "Something" >> myfinds.txt

are pipes.

Tee, like a T connector, diverts a copy of the contents of the "main
pipe", at the point where it was placed, to a file.

If no T file is specified, it writes or appends to a file named
tee.out. It recognizes the '-a' (append) option, and by default
overwrites the T file. Option '-i' is not supported.

Generic syntax: [pipe] | TEE [-a] [teefile] [ | pipe]
                TEE [-a] [teefile] < inputfile [ | pipe]

Examples:


type < infile.txt |tee

tee < infile.txt

Writes the contents of file infile.txt both to default file tee.out,
overwriting it, and to the standard output (monitor).


type < infile.txt | tee -a

tee -a < infile.txt

Appends the contents of file infile.txt to default file tee.out and
displays infile.txt to the standard output (monitor).


type < infile.txt | tee testfile.txt > lpt1

Writes the contents of file infile.txt to file testfile.txt and writes
infile.txt to the LPT1 serial port (printer 1.)


type < infile.txt | tee -a file1.txt | sort > outfile.txt

Appends the contents of file infile.txt to file file1.txt, the file is
sorted and the result written to outfile.txt.


tee file1.txt < infile.txt | sort | tee -a file2.txt | sort /r > prn

Writes infile.txt to file1.txt, sorts infile.txt, appends the result
to file2.txt, sorts the result in reverse order and writes it to
the printer (LPT1).

TEE is user-supported freeware with ANSI C source and a MS-DOS
executable.
